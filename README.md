Introducing "Morsse" ‚Äì a morse code learning platform where morse code beginners or amateurs can improve their skills by completing lessons of sending and receiving morse code signals. This app is for:

-   Amateur Radio Enthusiasts needing practice for obtaining the license.
-   Personal Challenge Seekers looking to master another skill.

Many existing morse code practice apps don't offer lessons of different varieties or accounts for tracking progress. Morsse aims to bridge the gap, providing lessons for users of all skill levels alike and allowing for continuous learning.

## üß± Core Functionality

-   **Lesson Creation:** Users can create new lessons with:
    -   A title describing content of the lesson.
    -   Sections of practice of sending or receiving text in morse code.
    -   A number representing its difficulty (1-5). 
-   **Lesson Retrieving:** Users can search up existing lessons sorted in differnet ways.
-   **Lesson Deletion:** A user can choose to delete the lesson created by self.
-   **Lesson Use:** Users can complete the lesson by sections to solidify their skill.

### Requirements

#### Lesson Stories

-   As a user, I want to create a lesson with sections so that it can be shared with others.
-   As a user, I want to delete a lesson created by me so that I can undo unwanted changes.
-   As a user, I want to take a lesson by sections so that I can improve my skills.
-   As a user, I want to keep track of the lessons I completed so that I won't repeat already taken lessons.

#### User Management Stories

-   As a user, I want to register for an account so that I can start using the app.
-   As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can create new lessons or take existing lessons.

-   As a user, I want to change my preferences so that I can personalize my experience on the website.
-   As a user, I want to delete my account if needed so that I can protect my privacy.
-   As a user, I want my reputation to increase when my lesson is completed so that more people will know about my lessons.
